Description: Free implementation of IEEE 1666-2011.
 libieee1666 is a free implementation of IEEE Standard 1666-2011, the IEEE
 standard that defines SystemC language. SystemC is an extensible C++ class
 library intended for modeling both software and hardware at different
 abstraction level of modeling and level of detail, using the power of C++.
 More than a hardware description language (HDL), SystemC is a system-level
 modeling language. SystemC is closely related to an emerging methodology known
 as Electronic System Level (ESL) design and verification.
