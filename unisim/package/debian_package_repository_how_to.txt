This document is intended for the debian repository maintainers

1) Building the packages
------------------------

IMPORTANT: You must have the source tarballs in the current directory.

$ <path-to-unisim-devel>/package/build-packages.sh i386-deb <version> <path-to-systemc-install> <path-to-TLM2.0-install>

You finally get unisim-tools*.deb, unisim-lib*.deb and unisim-simulators*.deb
Move these packages to <path-to-unisim.org/distributions/binary/deb>/dists/stable/main/binary-i386

2) Building the package list
----------------------------

This is the tree on the UNISIM web server for the debian repository:

http://unisim.org/distributions/binary/deb
|
- dists
   |
   - stable
       |
       - main
           |
           - binary-i386


Go into the debian repository, and run dpkg-scanpackages:
$ cd <path-to-unisim.org/distributions/binary/deb>
$ dpkg-scanpackages dists/stable/main/binary-i386 /dev/null | gzip -9c > dists/stable/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz

3) Using the repository in a debian packager such as synaptic, adept, or apt-get
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit /etc/apt/source.list.d/unisim.list with the following content:
deb http://unisim.org/distributions/binary/deb stable main


Update your local package list cache:
$ apt-get update
