This document is intended for the mandriva repository maintainers

1) Building the packages
------------------------

IMPORTANT: You must have the source tarballs in the current directory.

$ <path-to-unisim-devel>/package/build-packages.sh i586-rpm <version> <path-to-systemc-install> <path-to-TLM2.0-install>

You finally get unisim-tools*.rpm, and unisim-simulators*.rpm
Move these packages to <path-to-unisim.org/distributions/binary/rpm>

2) Building the package list
----------------------------

Go into the mandriva repository, and run genhdlist2:
$ cd <path-to-unisim.org/distributions/binary/rpm>
$ genhdlist2 .

3) Using the repository
-----------------------

$ urpmi.addmedia UNISIM http://unisim.org/distributions/binary/rpm
