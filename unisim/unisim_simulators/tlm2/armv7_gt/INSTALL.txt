INSTALLATION
------------

Requirements:
  - GNU bash
  - cmake (>= 2.8)
  - GNU flex
  - GNU bison
  - boost (http://www.boost.org) development package (libboost-devel for Redhat/Mandriva, libboost-graph-dev for Debian/Ubuntu)
  - libxml2 (http://xmlsoft.org/libxml2) development package (libxml2-devel for Redhat/Mandriva, libxml2-dev for Debian/Ubuntu)
  - zlib (http://www.zlib.net) development package (zlib1g-devel for Redhat/Mandriva, zlib1g-devel for Debian/Ubuntu)
  - libedit (http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline) development package (libedit-devel for Redhat/Mandriva, libedit-dev for Debian/Ubuntu)
  - Core SystemC Language >= 2.1 (http://www.systemc.org)

Optional:
  - CACTI 4.2 (power consumption library for SRAM structures)

Building instructions:
Create an empty directory to build the simulator and go into it. Then use cmake to configure it, and finally call make. For example: 
  $ mkdir <my-build-dir>
  $ cd <my-build-dir>
  $ cmake -Dwith_osci_systemc=<path-to-systemc-install-dir> -Dwith_osci_tlm2=<path-to-tlm2-install-dir> [-Dwith_cacti_4_2=<path-to-cacti-4.2-source-dir>] <path-to-simulator-source>
  $ make
The CACTI option is not required, but SystemC and TLM2 are compulsory.
The simulator will be created in the 'bin' directory and its data resources in the 'share' directory.

Installing (optional):
To install the simulator just type:
  $ make install
This will install it in your system, typically at /usr/bin and /usr/share, so you will usually require root permissions to do it.
If you want to install the software somewhere (for example in a user location) set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. For example (once the simulator has been built):
  $ cd <my-build-dir>
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<my-install-dir> .
  $ make install
