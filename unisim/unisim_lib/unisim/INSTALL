More details on installing these softwares are available at http://unisim.org/site/unisim_lib/start
The last version of the UNISIM Library is available for download at http://unisim.org/site/download/start

2. Building the UNISIM Library 'configure' scripts
--------------------------------------------------

If you’ve downloaded the UNISIM Library source code as a tarball, you can ignore this paragraph.
If you’ve downloaded the UNISIM Library source code with subversion, you first need to build the configure scripts:

$ cd unisim_lib
$ ./build-configure.sh

In case of failure while running ‘build-configure.sh’, check that ‘find’, ‘autoconf’ and ‘automake’ are correctly installed.

3. Configuring UNISIM Library
-----------------------------

$ cd unisim_lib
$ ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/unisim \
              --with-unisim-tools=${HOME}/unisim \
              --with-systemc=${HOME}/systemc \
              --with-tlm20=${HOME}/TLM-2008-06-09

Script configure also supports the following options:

    * --with-sdl=<path-to-sdl-install>: Override the search path for SDL C headers
    * --with-boost=<path-to-boost-install>: Override the search path for boost C++ headers
    * --with-libxml2=<path-to-libxml2-install>: Override the search path for libxml2 C headers
    * --with-zlib=<path-to-zlib-install>: Override the search path for zlib C headers
    * --with-libedit=<path-to-libedit-install>: Override the search path for libedit C headers
    * --with-ncurses=<path-to-ncurses-install>: Override the search path for ncurses C headers
    * --with-systemc=<path-to-systemc-install>: Override the search path for SystemC C++ headers
    * --with-tlm20=<path-to-tlm2.0-install>: Override the search path for TLM 2.0 C++ headers
    * --with-cacti=<path-to-cacti4.2-install>: Override the search path for Cacti 4.2 C++ headers
    * --enable-release: Compile both debug and release versions of components. Debug versions are more verbose than release versions
    * --disable-<directory>: Disable compilation of a whole subdirectory (e.g. --disable-unisim-service-os-linux_os prevents configure and make from entering directory unisim/service/os/linux_os)

4. Compiling the UNISIM Library source code
-------------------------------------------

$ make

5. Installing the UNISIM Library
