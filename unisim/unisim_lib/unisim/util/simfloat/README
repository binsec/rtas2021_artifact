SimFloat++ is a library of template classes implementing IEEE 754 floating point numbers.
The implementation is sufficiently complete to allow simulating precisely floating point computation
of a processor (overflow, underflow, ...).
The library has been extensively tested for all operations, all rounding modes
(about 100000 smartly selected random tests per operation and per rounding mode) on a POWERPC G3 processor.

The library is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1, see the file LICENSE.

Compilation:
As all the classes are templated, so compilation is made only at the instanciation.
Just include Floating.h or PPCFloating.h and instanciate the classes in your C++ code.
