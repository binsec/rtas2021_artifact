Requirements for build.sh:

The web site is generated in directory "site" using a bash script: build.sh
Typically, you run this script from a directory, the sub-directory "site" is then created in place.
The generated directory must be uploaded on web server at the right place.
About videos: At the moment, only .avi files are searched in directory "videos".
A video thumbnail is automatically generated using mplayer for the video gallery and the web pages.
A "play" logo is added to the thumbnail using "composite" from ImageMagick
About images: Each images are copied on the website as is. At the moment only .png and .jpg images are search in directory "images"
A thumbnail is generated automatically for the screenshot gallery.
About downloads: Each file is copied on the website as is.
