\section{System Level Validation}
\label{sec:system_level}

The tests presented in Section~\ref{sec:user_level} validated the user level ISA subset of the complete ARM7TDMI ISA.
Validation of the system level ISA is a more complicated.
Firstly, systematic tests as the random tests introduced in Section~\ref{sec:random_tests} are not feasible, due to the system dependencies of those instructions.
Secondly, there are not benchmarks as those presented in Section~\ref{sec:benchmark_suite} to validate the ARM7TDMI alone.
System benchmarks exist, but they require more components than those developed for the architecture targeted in this document (see Figure~\ref{fig:arm7tdmi_architecture}).

For those reasons we have developed a small kernel to test the following features of the system:
\begin{itemize}
	\item system bootup
	\item exception mechanism
	\item user/system mode switching
	\item ARM ISA to Thumb ISA switching
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
To validate the behavior of the ARM7TDMI simulator at system level we do not have any tool to do it automatically (we can not compare two outputs like presented in Section~\ref{sec:user_level}).
We performed all the validation manually, heavily using the debugging service provided with UNISIM and comparing the behavior of the simulator to the behavior described in the ARM manual.
All the tests were succesfully validated.
