\section{Tools}
\label{sec:tools}

For the validation of the ARM7TDMI simulator the following tools were used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Random test generator: tool created at CEA to create random tests from an input template. It is briefly described in Section~\ref{sec:random_tests}.
	\item GNU compilations tools for ARM:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item GCC version 3.4.5 (C compiler)
		\item AS version 2.15 (Assembler compiler)
		\item LD version 2.15 (Linker)
	\end{itemize}
	\item GNU debugger for ARM: gdb version 6.1.1
	\item Linksys NSLU2 containing an ARM9 microprocessor. This is the target platform to validate the simulator against.
\end{itemize}
