\section{Introduction}
In the developpement of new simulators an important task is the validation of the simulator against the real target architecture.
The objective of this task is to check that the behavior of the simulator closely matches that of the target architecture.
While a complete validation of a simulator is probably an impossible task, or at least very time consuming to be affordable, we present in this document the validation we have used over the ARM7 microprocessor simulator and its results.
We consider this validation to be enough to start using the simulator in the industrial and research domains with confidence.

The following section introduces the ARM7TDMI microprocessor and its simulator implemented by the CEA LIST.
Section~\ref{sec:tools} presents the tools used to perform the validation.
Section~\ref{sec:user_level} presents the methodology used to test the user level instructions of the simulator and its results. Section~\ref{sec:system_level} presents the tests performed to validate the simulator at system level and their results.

Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} presents the report conclusion.
