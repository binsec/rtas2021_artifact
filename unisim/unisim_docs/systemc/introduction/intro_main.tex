As stated in the \emph{``SystemC 2.0 User's Guide''} by the Accellera Consortium, we can define SystemC as:
\begin{quote}
	``A C++ class library and methodology that you can use to effectively create a cycle-accurate model of software algorithms, hardware architecture, and interfaces of your SoC (System On a Chip) and system-level designs.''
\end{quote}
Ok, this already says us what is the purpose of SystemC: create software models of SoCs and system-level designs. 
For that purpose SystemC provides a C++ class library and methodology\footnote{Yes, it provides a methodology, but it is focused at the component model. Actually, you will need to extend the SystemC methodology to define how the system components communicate.}.

The ``cycle-accurate'' part of the definition is a little bit outdated.
Currently, SystemC allows you not only to create cycle-accurate models, but for example purely functional models.
We will see in sligthly more detail which kind of models you can create with SystemC\footnote{Or at least the main ones. As we previously mentioned, SystemC is in constant evolution.}.

In the following sections we will try to define a little bit more in detail what is SystemC, and a rough view of the models you can create with it.
A more detailed description of those models  will be given in the following chapters.
